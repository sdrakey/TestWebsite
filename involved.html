							<h3>Tim Knight - Musical Director</h3>
							<p>
							Tim became Musical Director of Leeds Male Voice Choir in January 2014 and he quickly re-established Leeds Male Voice Choir as a popular feature on local music scene. Under Tim’s leadership, innovative and diverse concert programming, expanding audiences and the continued growth in membership have resulted in one of the most exciting periods in the choir’s 100 year history.
							Born in Northallerton, Tim became a chorister in York Minster Choir under Dr Francis Jackson, with the daily round of choral services exposing him to an immense and diverse repertoire.

As a conductor, he has worked with choirs large and small and held posts with Wakefield Festival Chorus, Vocalis, The York Rose Singers, Thornton Vocal Union, The Eldon Singers and a host of other celebrated Northern Choirs. He runs two choirs he founded, The Heritage Singers and The Heritage Masterworks Chorale.
							The Heritage Singers have sung choral evensong throughout Yorkshire for the past twenty years and work to maintain and restore the Anglican choral tradition in areas without access to a regular choir. The Heritage Masterworks Chorale was founded in 2009 to provide concerts in venues that do not have access to choral music and tour internationally.
							</p>
							<p>
							As composer Tim’s music is distributed worldwide; he was nominated in three times in the Classic FM Hall of Fame in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and his work has been performed in concert halls, schools and Cathedrals within the UK, Europe and America. He has undertaken a composer in residence visit to Clarke University Dubuque in Iowa for the premiere of his Requiem aeternam and in 2015 and 2016 acted as a judge in the Canco Mediterrania International Choir Competition in Barcelona.
							As Principal of the Yorkshire College of Music and Drama Tim is responsible for the college’s management and operations also acting as composition, theory and singing teacher. He has previously held also the position of Music and Festivals Officer on the Executive board of the National Association of Choirs and in 2016 was elected as the Chairman for the Royal School of Church Music committee in the Ripon and Leeds area.

					<h4>Choir Quotes</h4>
						<div class="blog-grids">
							‘We really do span the generations,’ ‘And it brings an interesting energy to everything we do. A couple of members who’ve been with us for more than 40 years genuinely seem to be enjoying a whole new lease of life.’ Robert Butler.

							There’s something about that sound of all men singing,"  "It’s mellow. It’s stirring. And I think, as a pastime, it’s coming back around.” Lee Wallace.

						<div class="blog-grids">
							“Everyone goes for a pint after rehearsals, and we do other social activities together such as carol singing at Christmas and getting together for Bonfire Night. Singing in a male voice choir – particularly this one – has a unique sense of camaraderie which you don’t find in other kinds of ensemble or group. It’s very rewarding.” Oscar Archer

							“It’s very important,”“In fact, I think it’s probably what’s kept me going as I am. It’s a social experience, and of course it’s exercise for your lungs. Not that my lungs are as good as they once were, of course.” Bert Mallison
