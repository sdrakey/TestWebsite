							Leeds Male Voice Choir was formed in 1916 as the Broom Excelsior Male Voice Choir by Thomas Crossland, who was the organist and choirmaster at Stourton Wesleyan Chapel in Leeds. The choir took its name from Broom Pit in Middleton, South Leeds with the early membership was comprised of colliery workers from the Middleton and Hunslet areas of the city.
							Under Crossland’s direction the choir, raised money to support those injured during the Great War and performed for the first time at Leeds Town Hall in 1919. During the 1920’s the choir continued to perform locally for charity and enter musical competitions.
							By the 1930’s John Hickes led the choir and maintained a local concert schedule alongside appearances in musical competitions. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the choir continued to perform through the city often at Mill Hill Chapel on Park Row in Leeds, where Hicks was also choirmaster. With the transfer of the coal mining industry to the National Coal Board in 1947, Hickes oversaw the renaming of the choir, which by 1948 was known as Leeds Male Voice Choir.

							<p>Great success came under the leadership of John Wheeler who became musical director in 1963 with his wife Ursula joining as the choir’s accompanist. John was a principal singer at Leeds Parish Church and also conducted Batley Male Voice Choir and Phoenix Park Male Voice Choir in Bradford. He led the choir and began a series of exchange visits with Leeds’ twin city Dortmund in Germany and return visits became a popular and prominent feature during the nineteen seventies.  In 1966 the choir celebrated 50 years in the People’s Hall on Albion Street in Leeds with the Rothwell Temperance Band.</p>

							By 1971 the choir was a force to be reckoned with on the local music scene, taking first prize in the Robertshaw Music Festival in Bingley. Television appearances followed with the choir taking part in Hughie Green’s Opportunity Knocks and featuring on Stars on Sunday as part of the ‘1000 Voice Choir’, accompanied by the Black Dyke Band at Leeds Town Hall. By 1978 the choir released their first album featuring some of the traditional male voice choir repertoire, with the now famous photograph outside Leeds Civic Hall, which the choir re-created in 2014.
							Between the 1986 and 1994 under the direction of Nigel Wears, the choir increased in size and scope whilst maintaining its local concert schedule throughout the city and visited the Royal Albert Hall twice to perform in the 1,000 Yorkshire Voices concerts accompanied by the Brighouse and Rastrick and Sellers International Brass Bands, also performing at Ripley Castle with the Halle Orchestra.

							<p>The choir’s seventy fifth anniversary concert took place in 1991 in Leeds Town Hall accompanied by Sellers International Brass Band with support from a number of male voice choirs including York, Castleford, Micklefield and Liverpool. Between 1994 and 2004 the choir was directed by David Burnett, who maintained a busy and popular concert schedule throughout the city again returning to the Royal Albert Hall to perform in the 1,000 Yorkshire Voices concert.
								Conducted by Michael Grant following the turn of the millennium Leeds Male Voice Choir, continued to perform at a host of venues throughout Leeds and raise money for local charities.</p>

						In 2013 under the direction of Will Prideaux, the choir hosted a charity project in aid of Help for Heroes. Many of those that performed in the Sing for Heroes concert in Leeds Town Hall decided to keep singing with the choir. The injection of new members has had a beneficial effect on the quality of sound blending younger voices with mature voices to create a noticeably richer sound. The year concluded with Christmas carols and songs at Holy Trinity Church supported by the women’s choir, Peterborough Voices, to a sell-out audience.</p>

							<p>Renewed success followed the appointment of Tim Knight as Musical Director and Matthew Lazenby as accompanist in 2014.
